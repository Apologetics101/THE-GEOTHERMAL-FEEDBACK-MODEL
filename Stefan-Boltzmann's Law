Total Heat Generated During the Flood Year:
1.8147760035296923 × 10³⁰ J

Phase 1: Heating Phase (First 5 Months)
Removed 26.1% of total heat
= 0.261 × 1.8147760035296923 × 10³⁰
= 4.7365653692124969 × 10²⁹ J

Phase 2: Cooling Phase (Final 7 Months)
Removed 50.9% of total heat
= 0.509 × 1.8147760035296923 × 10³⁰
= 9.2372098579661338 × 10²⁹ J

Phase 3: Post-Flood Removal Phase
Remaining 23.0% of heat removed after the Flood
= 0.23 × 1.8147760035296923 × 10³⁰
= 4.1739848081182923 × 10²⁹ J
